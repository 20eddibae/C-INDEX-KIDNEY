# C-Index Regression Analysis: KiTS23 vs KiTS19 Manual

## Executive Summary

This analysis compares the automatically calculated C-index values from KiTS23 dataset with the manually calculated C-index values from KiTS19 dataset using least squares regression analysis.

## Dataset Information

- **Total cases analyzed**: 298 cases with both KiTS23 and KiTS19 data
- **KiTS23 C-index range**: 0.191 - 2.967
- **KiTS19 C-index range**: 0.240 - 10.460
- **Data overlap**: 298 out of 489 KiTS23 cases matched with KiTS19 cases

## Regression Results

### Primary Findings

**Regression Equation:**
```
KiTS19_C_index = 0.996 × KiTS23_C_index + 0.625
```

**Key Metrics:**
- **R² (Coefficient of determination)**: 0.145 (14.5%)
- **Correlation coefficient (r)**: 0.381
- **P-value**: < 0.001 (highly statistically significant)
- **RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)**: 1.272
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: 0.907

### Statistical Significance

- **Correlation significance**: *** (p < 0.001) - Highly significant
- **Correlation strength**: Weak (0.381)

## Interpretation

### What the Results Mean

1. **Weak but Significant Correlation**: While the correlation is statistically significant (p < 0.001), the R² of 0.145 indicates that only 14.5% of the variance in KiTS19 manual C-index values can be explained by the KiTS23 automated C-index values.

2. **Systematic Bias**: The Bland-Altman analysis shows a mean difference (bias) of -0.619, indicating that KiTS23 values tend to be lower than KiTS19 manual values.

3. **Agreement Limits**: The 95% limits of agreement are [-3.112, 1.874], suggesting substantial variability between the two methods.

### Methodological Differences

The weak correlation likely reflects fundamental differences between the two approaches:

1. **KiTS23 Method**: Uses kidney radius (volume-based spherical approximation)
2. **KiTS19 Method**: Uses tumor radius (extent-based maximum distance)

This explains why the correlation is weak - the two methods measure different aspects of tumor centrality.

## Visualizations Generated

The analysis created comprehensive visualizations including:

1. **Regression scatter plot** with fitted line
2. **Residuals plot** to assess model fit
3. **Bland-Altman plot** for agreement analysis

## Conclusions

1. **Statistical Significance**: The correlation is statistically significant but weak
2. **Methodological Differences**: The two approaches measure different aspects of tumor centrality
3. **Limited Agreement**: The methods show limited agreement, suggesting they capture different clinical aspects
4. **Further Investigation Needed**: Additional analysis of individual components (distance, radius) may provide more insights

## Recommendations

1. **Consider Both Methods**: Both approaches may have clinical value for different aspects of tumor assessment
2. **Component Analysis**: Analyze distance and radius components separately
3. **Clinical Validation**: Validate both methods against clinical outcomes
4. **Method Refinement**: Consider hybrid approaches that combine both methodologies
